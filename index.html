        <h3><a href="#">Eternal Return</a></h3>

        <p> Eternal Return, or Eternal Recurrence, in its Nietzschean formulation, represents in simple terms what one might argue
            to be the essence of much of Nietzsche's thought. The thought expiriment more or less posits that time is cyclical, 
            and that all events in one's life will recur infinitely in the exact same sequence. It is an absurd cosmological hypothesis, but to see it in these terms 
            would miss a half of its presentation. It is moreseo a challenge that Nietzsche puts forth. 
            
            It is a test of one's affirmation of life. If you could accept, or even embrace reliving your life ad infinitum, then you most 
            likely have lived a worthy one that is worth loving. Nietzsche uses this confrontation to undermine the essence of religious morality, especially of those
            which he deems "world-weary". Eternal return rejects the afterlife in favor of an ultimate embrace of the present. Ultimately, this idea is a call to action,
            in which Nietzsche urges one to, as he would say, "Build your cities on the slopes of Vesuvius".</p>
