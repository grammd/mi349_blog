        <h3><a href="#">Eternal Return</a></h3>
        <div class="post-meta">Published: June 8, 2025 &bull; Author: Dominic Grammatico</div>
          
        <p> Eternal Return, or Eternal Recurrence, in its Nietzschean formulation, represents in simple terms what one might argue
            to be the essence of much of Nietzsche's thought. The thought expiriment more or less posits that time is cyclical, 
            and that all events in one's life will recur infinitely in the exact same sequence. It is an absurd cosmological hypothesis, but to see it in these terms 
            would miss a half of its presentation. It is moreseo a challenge that Nietzsche puts forth. 
            
            It is a test of one's affirmation of life. If you could accept, or even embrace reliving your life ad infinitum, then you most 
            likely have lived a worthy one that is worth loving. Nietzsche uses this confrontation to undermine the essence of religious morality, especially of those
            which he deems "world-weary". Eternal return rejects the afterlife in favor of an ultimate embrace of the present. Ultimately, this idea is a call to action,
            in which Nietzsche urges one to, as he would say, "Build your cities on the slopes of Vesuvius".</p>

        <h3><a href="#">The Overman</a></h3>
        <div class="post-meta">Published: June 8, 2025 &bull; Author: Dominic Grammatico</div>
        <p>The aim of Nietzsche's Zarathrustra, and in many ways his larger project, is not just to tear down idols and to conduct a revaluation of values, but to replace
            this with the ideal of the Overman (Ubermensch). In this sense the overman is not a higher human being but transcends humanity altogether, and thus could never
            actually be achieved. The overman embraces the will to power, and the striving to overcome oneself. He creates new, life-affirming values as he sheds the 
            morality of the herd. 
        
            The last man, the Letzter mensch, is the antithesis of the overman. The last man embodies the current age, he is nihilistic, weary of the world, and seeks not to 
            expand but to shrink himself, wanting only comfort and decadence. "The opposite of the overman [Übermensch] is the last man: I created him at the same time with that. 
            Everything superhuman appears to man as illness and madness. You have to be a sea to absorb a dirty stream without getting dirty." This is the dichotomy of the last man and the overman,
            the personified dialectic which appears often in Nietzsche's work.
